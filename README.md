Hello Everyone, I recently did a project evaluating the accruracy of YOLOv8 in the detection of surfacce aquatic trash. I carried ot 3 tests

Optimal train-to-valid ratio
Effect of rain on accuracy of YOLOv8
Effect of brightness on the accuracy of YOLOv8
I have attached all the codes I used in hopes that it can help anyone carrying out a similar project. Descriptions of each code is in the "Codes Explained" file.
